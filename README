  Some random scripts. Just trying to be like the cool kids. Place all
  the scripts under /usr/local/bin and hack away.

Set-up one-liner

  This will clone this repository and then move all scripts to 
  /usr/local/bin.

    $ git clone git@github.com:EdOverflow/hacks.git \
      && cp -R hacks/. /usr/local/bin/ \
      && echo "You can delete the ./hacks/ folder now."
